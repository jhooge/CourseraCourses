Exploratory Data Analysis
=========================

This repository includes excercises and their solutions for the Coursera Course "Exploratory Data Analysis"

For more information about the requirements for this excercise and information about the input dataset, please refer too [ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md "ExDataPlotting")

<h2>How it works</h2>

All the plots for this excecise have been generated, using the base R plotting capabilities. The resulting figures can be found in [myfigures](https://github.com/jhooge/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/4_ExploratoryDataAnalysis/peerAssessment/CourseProject_1/myfigures "myfigures")

The code for the respective plots can be found in <b>plot1.R, ..., plot4.R</b>. The recommended way of reproducing the figures, is by using the convenience function <b>plotConsumption::plotAll</b>. This function not only saves all figures at once in PNG format, but also reformats the input data and ensures that the output folder exists, where those figures will be stored. The function expects the input data in a zip file called <b>"exdata_data_household_power_consumption.zip"</b>, located in the current working directory. This file is also provided by this repository.
