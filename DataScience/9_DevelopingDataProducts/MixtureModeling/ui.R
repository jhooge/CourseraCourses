                                      This tool has been created as part of the Coursera Course \"Developing Data Products\". 
                                      It uses Mixtures of Gaussians for a Model Based Cluster analysis of the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. 
                                      Up to ten components can be chosen for the mixtures. The supervised classification result, together 
                                      with classification uncertainty and errors can be observed in 2D projections of the feature space. 
                                      Densities for each feature is estimated and provides an overview of the feature space. The best model 
                                      is chosen over all components and 10 different covariance structures, which determine the volume, 
                                      shape and orientation of the gaussian hyper-spheres fitted to the data. The optimal fit is determined 
                                      by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). When fitting models, it is possible to increase the 
                                      likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. The BIC resolves this problem  
                                      by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model.

                                      Minnesota (Knowler, Bennett et al. 1978). The National Institute of Diabetes and
